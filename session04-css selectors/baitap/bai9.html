        <b>This is the first item's accorditon body.</b> It is shown by default,
         until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style

         transtions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. it's also
          worth nothing that just about any HTML can go within the <span>.caaorfion-body</span>, though the 
          transtion does limit overflow.
