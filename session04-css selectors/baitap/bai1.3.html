    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
    <p id="p1">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a website</p>
    <p id="p2">With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text,
        the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and
        laid out, what backgroud images or backgroud colors are to be
        used. diffirent devices and screen sizes, and much more!
    </p>
    <p id="p3"><b>Tip:</b> the word <b>cascading</b> means that a style applied to a parent element will 
        also apply to all children elements within the parents. So, if you set the color of the
        body text to "blue", all headings paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will 
        also get the same color (unless you specify something else)!
